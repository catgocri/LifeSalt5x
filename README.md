# PotionCraft Life Salt Buff
A Potion Craft mod which makes one grain of Life Salt heal your potion more than before (AKA makes Life Salt not overpriced and useless.)
My experimentation shows that it takes roughly `50` grains to heal a near-fully depleted potion back to full health, as opposed to the previous `200` without using the mod. Essentially you get four times the value from one batch of Life Salt, nifty eh?
## Installation
This mod uses BepInEx 5! BepInEx is a mod loader, basically it is what puts the edited code into the game.
- Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract the zip file.
- Drag the extracted folder into your Potion Craft folder, you should be able to find the Potion Craft folder at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Potion Craft`
- Run Potion Craft once with BepInEx installed.
- Download the mod from the [GitHub](https://github.com/catgocri/LifeSalt5x) page.
- Drag `potioncraft-lifesaltbuff.dll` into `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- You are good to go!
## Deinstallation
Uninstalling this mod is as easy as deleting one file, you don't even need to delete [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)!
- Navigate to `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- Remove `potioncraft-lifesaltbuff.dll` from the folder.
- You are done!
