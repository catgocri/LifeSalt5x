# PotionCraft Life Salt 5x
A Potion Craft mod which makes Life Salt 5x stronger (AKA makes it not useless). Essentially one grain dropped into the cauldron while using this mod will heal your
potion the same amount five grains would when not using the mod.
## Installation
This mod uses BepInEx 5! BepInEx is a mod loader, basically it is what puts the edited code into the game.
- Install [BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract the zip file.
- Drag the extracted folder into your Potion Craft folder, you should be able to find the Potion Craft folder at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Potion Craft`
- Run Potion Craft once with BepInEx installed.
- Download the mod from the [GitHub](https://github.com/catgocri/LifeSalt5x) page.
- Drag `potioncraft-lifesalt5x.dll` into `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- You are good to go!
## Uninstallation
Uninstalling this mod is as easy as deleting one file, you don't even need to delete [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases)!
- Navigate to `Potion Craft\BepInEx\Plugins`
- Remove `potioncraft-lifesalt5x.dll` from the folder.
- You are done!
